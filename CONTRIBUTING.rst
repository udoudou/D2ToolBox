Contributions Guide
========================

We welcome contributions to the D2ToolBox project!

How to Contribute
--------------------

Contributions to D2ToolBox - fixing bugs, adding features, adding documentation - are welcome. We accept contributions via `GitHub Pull Requests <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests>`_.

Before Contributing
----------------------

Before sending us a Pull Request, please consider this list of points:

* Is the contribution entirely your own work, or already licensed under an Apache License 2.0 compatible Open Source License? If not then we unfortunately cannot accept it.

* Have you installed the `pre-commit hook <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/contribute/install-pre-commit-hook.html>`_ for the D2ToolBox project?

* If the contribution contains multiple commits, are they grouped together into logical changes (one major change per pull request)? Are any commits with names like "fixed typo" `squashed into previous commits <http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/02/19/squashing-github-pull-requests-into-a-single-commit>`_?

* If you're unsure about any of these points, please open the Pull Request anyhow and then ask me for feedback.

Pull Request Process
-----------------------

After you open the Pull Request, there will probably be some discussion in the comments field of the request itself.
